            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1', this)">How much does it cost to replace a Range Rover key?
<span></span></button>
                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">The cost of replacing a Range Rover key can vary significantly based on the model and year of your vehicle. Dealerships often charge between $500 to $1,000 for a new key fob and programming. However, some vehicle owners have found more affordable alternatives. For instance, one user mentioned purchasing a key for $20 on Amazon and using a GAP IID tool to program it themselves, saving a substantial amount. 
</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Can I program a new Range Rover key myself?
<span></span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">Programming a new Range Rover key yourself is possible but depends on the specific model and year of your vehicle. Some users have successfully used tools like the GAP IID to program new keys. However, others have encountered challenges, especially with newer models. In some cases, even dealerships have faced difficulties, leading to situations where a new key only partially functions, such as unlocking doors but not starting the vehicle.

</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">What should I do if I've lost all my Range Rover keys?
 <span></span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">If you've lost all your Range Rover keys, it's essential to act promptly. For certain models, if the vehicle is unlocked, a new key can be programmed without replacing major components. However, if the vehicle is locked and the security system is armed, you might need to replace the Remote Function Actuator (RFA) and possibly the Body Control Module (BCM). It's advisable to consult with a professional locksmith or your dealership to determine the best course of action based on your specific situation.
